With a file to zip file to download.  

I downloaded the file and then started to look at the website.  

I registered an account and tried to acquire a cookie from an admin who may be logging in and looking at the page.  This did not work.  

I then checked the zip file I had downloaded.  Unzipped it and had a read through some of the files.  

What caught my interest in the `bot.py` file was potential admin credentials.  I tried those on the website and sure enough I was logged in.  

Looking at the file `db.sql` I could see the flag would be stored in a post entitled `flag` so I viewed the first post with this and found the flag.
