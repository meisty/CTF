# CTT F**k you Putin CTF

Between 02/04/22 - 03/04/22 I took part in a Capture the Flag event set up to raise funds for [British Ukrainian Aid](https://british-ukrainianaid.org/)

[CTT F**k you putin justgiving](https://justgiving.com/fundraising/capturethetalent)

It was organised by Amy and Shaun from [Capture The Talent](https://capturethetalent.co.uk/) 

The event was really well organised and everyone that took part were friendly and there was a great community feeling to this one.  I look forward to competing in future CTT events, thanks for taking the time and effort to put on such a fun event. 

It was a great mix of fun challenges that almost everyone could solve to more difficult ones that had you stuck for a substantial period of time.  I really enjoyed it and have put together writeups of some of the challenges I solved during the event. I didn't make notes on all of the challenges I solved, something I need to work on.
