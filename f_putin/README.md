# F**k you Putin CTF

Between 02/04/22 - 03/04/22 I took part in a Capture the Flag event set up to raise funds for [British Ukrainian Aid](https://british-ukrainianaid.org/)

[F**k you putin justgiving](https://justgiving.com/fundraising/capturethetalent)

It was organised by Amy and Shaun from [capturethetalent](https://capturethetalent.co.uk/) 

It was a great mix of fun challenges that almost everyone could solve to more difficult ones that had you stuck for a substantial period of time.  I really enjoyed it and have put together writeups of some of the challenges I solved during the event.
