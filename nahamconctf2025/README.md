Our team `5h4d0wbr0k3r5` always take part in NahamCon CTF.  Its a capture the flag event we really look forward to each year.  

Unfortunately this year not many of us could take part in the CTF but we had fun and still managed to get #235. 

Here are some writeups for some of the challenges I completed.
